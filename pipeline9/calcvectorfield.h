		// entries. Here it is a flat open-addressed table: one cache line per lookup, no
		// per-entry allocation, and less memory.

		// 5^3 window, and with one voxel per slot those 125 probes land on 125 unrelated cache
		// lines. The 125 taps of a window lie in at most 8 blocks of side 4, so with a block per
		// slot the same 125 probes land in 8 regions of 784 bytes and all but the first few hit
		// L1. Nothing about what the cache returns changes: the key of a voxel is decomposed into
		// (block, offset) by a mapping that is one-to-one, so two voxels share an entry exactly
		// when they shared one before, including the keys the caller packs badly.

		// 87 % of its load misses in this table and in the routine that reads it. A 2 MiB page
		// covers 512 times what a 4 KiB page covers, and nothing else about the table changes:
		// same size, same hash, same probe order, same values, only the addresses differ.
